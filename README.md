Welcome to the Hangman Game project! This is a classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word letter by letter. The game provides a fun and interactive way to test your vocabulary and deduction skills.

## Features

- Randomly selects words for players to guess.
- Tracks the number of incorrect guesses and displays a hangman figure accordingly.
- Displays the current state of the word being guessed, showing correctly guessed letters and placeholders for remaining letters.
- Allows players to input their guesses and receive feedback on whether the guess was correct or not.
